You are taking a walk through town on a sunny day.
The streets are not so busy, every now and then you are passed by some people.
You turn a corner and notice two men about to fight, it seems serious but you are not sure whether to stop the fight or just let it play out.




Decisions:
1. You can jump between them and try to stop the fight.
2. You can stand on the corner and see what happens.
